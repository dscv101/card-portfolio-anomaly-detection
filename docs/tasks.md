# Implementation Tasks: Python Anomaly Detection System

**Project:** Card Portfolio Anomaly Detection  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Draft  
**Date:** 2025-11-19  
**Owner:** Data Science Team  
**Related Specs:** requirements.md, design.md

---

## Task Organization

This document breaks down the implementation into phased, executable tasks that follow the system architecture defined in design.md. Each task is:

- **Atomic:** Completable in 1-4 hours by a single developer/AI agent
- **Testable:** Has clear acceptance criteria and test cases
- **Traceable:** Maps to specific requirements and design components
- **Sequenced:** Dependencies explicitly stated

### Task Notation

**Task ID Format:** `PHASE-MODULE-SEQUENCE`
- Example: `P1-DATA-001` = Phase 1, Data module, Task 001

**Priority Levels:**
- **P0:** Blocking for MVP (must have)
- **P1:** Important for production (should have)
- **P2:** Enhancement for v2.0 (nice to have)

## Phase 0: Project Setup

[All tasks from P0-SETUP-001 through P0-SETUP-004...]

## Phase 1: Data Layer

[All tasks from P1-DATA-001 through P1-DATA-005...]

[Continue through all 8 phases...]
